#Level 1

#lets log into the ssh with the new password

ssh leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p2223 -l leviathan1

#lets see if we can snoop around like the first level using ls -la

ls -la

#there is a file that is highlighted in red saying "check"
#lets cd check to see what's inside it

cd check

#that didnt work, so lets ./check

./check

#it's asking for a password
#typing in leviathan1 doesn't work so we may need to look around
#let's try ltrace ./check that can show 
#the background string code that is looking
#for the password

ltrace ./check

#it is showing the code and asking for the password again.
#when you put in the wrong code it shows the password it is looking for in
#the " strcmp " which stands for string to compare, and it is comparing 
#the bad password I typed in, with the right password which is " sex " 
#so lets ./check again and type in the right password

./check

sex

#the section up next is blank so we need to see the user.
#to see who the user is that we are logged in as
#you can use " id " or "whoami"
#I'll use " id "

id

#now it shows 
#" uid=12001(leviathan1) gid=12001(leviathan1) euid=12002(leviathan2) groups=12002(leviathan2),12001(leviathan1) "
#this shows the users who were last in
#similar to the first level, lets cat the "/etc/leviathan_pass"
#and see if anything is in leviathan2 since it is showing up in the 2nd userid

cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2

#it shows a password " ougahZi8Ta "
