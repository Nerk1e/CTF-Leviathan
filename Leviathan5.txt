#log in and use the password

#now that we are logged in, lets take a look around

ls -la

#we see a highlighted file called leviathan5
#we cannot get in as easily as the last level with cd or ./ 
#so we need to go another route
#we do see that there is a /tmp/file.log so that is a clue
#we are making a symlink taking the tmp file and looking for the password in leviathan6

ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log

#now lets see if there is a code like last file with ./ and use the leviathan5 file

./leviathan5

#we got a password " UgaoFee4li "
