#well this is a very short and unique level
#if we ls -la it 
#it will show level3 file

ls -la

#if we type ./level3 it will ask for a password

./level3

#we do not know the password

ltrace

#if we ltrace then it will show the code and have strcmp("h0no33", "kakaka") 
#type kakaka for password

kakaka

#it will be wrong and then it will show strcmp("kakaka\n", "snlprintf\n")   
#if you type snlprintf it will say correct and say
# puts("[You've got shell]!"[You've got shell]!

snlprintf

#so snlprintf seems to be the password needed to open ./level3
#type ./level3 and put the password in then ask whoami

./level3

whoami

#typing in whoami will show the username leviathan4
#then type cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4 for password to next level

cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4

#password is vuH0coox6m
